## Introduction
Welcome to Sirened, a book discovery platform that connects readers and authors through shared interests. This Privacy Policy explains our unique approach to facilitating these connections. Sirened is free for readers to use because authors fund the platform through their marketing investments.

## How Sirened Works
Sirened serves as a discovery bridge between readers and authors through a simple process:

1. You browse recommendations on our homepage
2. You explore books that catch your interest 
3. You view book detail pages created by authors
4. If interested, you click through to the author's external sales page

At no point do you make purchases on Sirened itself. We simply facilitate discovery and connections, with transactions happening on the author's own platforms.

## Our Data-Driven Business Model
Authors pay Sirened to connect with readers who have expressed interest in their type of work. This author funding is what allows us to offer the platform completely free to readers. In exchange for free access, readers share their anonymized interest data, which helps authors better understand their audience.

## Required Data Sharing
