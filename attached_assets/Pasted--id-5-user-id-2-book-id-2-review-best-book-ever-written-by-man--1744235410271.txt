The film follows Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), heir to House Atreides, as his family is thrust into a power struggle over the desert planet Arrakis, the only source of \"spice,\" a substance that fuels interstellar travel and enhances human potential. What unfolds is a tale of political intrigue, ecological stakes, and messianic prophecy, all rendered with breathtaking scale and precision.",
